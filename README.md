    <p>This repository contains an SQL file for an E-Commerce platform database schema along with sample data.</p>

    <h2>Database Description</h2>
    <p>The SQL file (SQL-DATABASE.sql) contains the schema definition for the database tables used in the E-Commerce platform. It also includes sample data inserts to provide initial data for testing and development purposes.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/samgeeksdev/SQL-DATABASE.git</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Import the SQL File:</strong></p>
    <p>Use a MySQL client (such as phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench) to import the <code>ecommerce_database.sql</code> file into your MySQL database server. This will create the database schema along with sample data in your MySQL instance.</p>
    <p><strong>Start Using the Database:</strong></p>
    <p>You can now connect your application to the MySQL database and start using the E-Commerce platform.</p>
